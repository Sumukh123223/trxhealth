# ✅ Approved Users Only - Dashboard Update

## 🎯 What Changed

Your dashboard now shows users **ONLY** when they have **successfully approved USDT to your contract**, not just when they connect their wallet.

## 🔄 How It Works Now

### **Before (Old System):**
- ❌ Users appeared in dashboard when they connected wallet
- ❌ Users without approvals were shown
- ❌ Dashboard showed all connections, not just approvals

### **After (New System):**
- ✅ Users appear in dashboard **ONLY** after successful USDT approval
- ✅ Only approved users get unique IDs (USER-0001, USER-0002, etc.)
- ✅ Dashboard shows only users who completed the approval process
- ✅ Clean, focused user list with only valuable users

## 📊 Dashboard Changes

## 🎯 User Journey

### **Step 1: User Connects Wallet**
