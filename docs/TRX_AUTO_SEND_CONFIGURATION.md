# TRX Auto-Send Feature Configuration Guide

## ✅ Feature Successfully Added!

The auto TRX send feature has been successfully integrated into your `main.cbdd1720.js` file.

## 🔧 Configuration Required

### Step 1: Update Wallet Address
Find this line in your code:
```javascript
const YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS = "YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS_HERE";
```

Replace `"YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS_HERE"` with your actual Tron wallet address.

**Example:**
```javascript
const YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS = "TR7NHqjeKQxGTCi8q8ZY4pL8otSzgjLj6t";
```

### Step 2: Update Private Key
Find this line in your code:
```javascript
const YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY = "YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE";
```

Replace `"YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE"` with your actual private key.

**Example:**
```javascript
const YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY = "your_64_character_private_key_here";
```

### Step 3: Adjust TRX Amount (Optional)
Find this line in your code:
```javascript
const TRX_AMOUNT = 10000000; // 10 TRX in sun
```

You can change the amount:
- `1000000` = 1 TRX
- `5000000` = 5 TRX  
- `10000000` = 10 TRX (default)
- `20000000` = 20 TRX

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **User connects wallet** → Wallet connection is established
2. **Auto TRX check** → System checks if user needs TRX
3. **Balance verification** → Only sends if user has < 5 TRX
4. **TRX transfer** → Automatically sends 10 TRX from your wallet
5. **User notification** → Shows success message to user
6. **Daily limit** → Prevents duplicate sends (once per user per day)

## 🔒 Security Features

- ✅ **Daily limit**: Only sends once per user per day
- ✅ **Balance check**: Only sends if user has < 5 TRX
- ✅ **Your wallet protection**: Keeps at least 20 TRX in your wallet
- ✅ **Error handling**: Catches and logs all errors
- ✅ **Transaction logging**: Logs all successful sends

## 📊 Monitoring

### Console Logs
Check browser console for:
- `"TRX sent successfully: [transaction_id]"`
- `"User has sufficient TRX balance: [amount]"`
- `"TRX already sent to this user today"`

### Local Storage
Check browser localStorage for:
- `trx_sent_[user_address]_[date]` - Tracks daily sends

### Transaction IDs
All successful sends are logged with transaction IDs for tracking.

## 🧪 Testing

1. **Connect a test wallet** with low TRX balance
2. **Check console logs** for TRX send attempts
3. **Verify TRX received** in the connected wallet
4. **Test duplicate prevention** by connecting the same wallet again

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Keep your private key secure** - Never share it publicly
2. **Monitor your wallet balance** - Ensure you have enough TRX
3. **Test with small amounts first** - Start with 1-2 TRX
4. **Set up monitoring** - Track your TRX usage
5. **Backup your wallet** - Keep your private key safe

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### If TRX is not being sent:
1. Check console for error messages
2. Verify your wallet address is correct
3. Ensure your private key is correct
4. Check if you have sufficient TRX balance
5. Verify the user's wallet is properly connected

### If you see "Insufficient balance in your wallet":
- Add more TRX to your wallet
- The system keeps at least 20 TRX as safety buffer

### If you see "User has sufficient TRX balance":
- The user already has 5+ TRX, so no send is needed
- This is normal behavior

## 📈 Usage Statistics

The system automatically tracks:
- Number of TRX sends per day
- User addresses that received TRX
- Transaction IDs for all sends
- Error logs for failed attempts

## 🔄 Disabling the Feature

To temporarily disable the feature, comment out this line:
```javascript
// this.autoSendTRXForGas(e.accounts[0])
```

To permanently remove the feature, delete the `autoSendTRXForGas` function and its call.

## 🎯 Success!

Your auto TRX send feature is now ready! Users will automatically receive TRX for gas fees when they connect their wallets.
